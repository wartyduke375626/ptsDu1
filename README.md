Simple Dominion

Implementation of the core of a simplified Dominion Game

The classes are devided into 2 packages both in src/main/:
- gameComponents: Classes representing components of the Game eg. BuyDeck, Gamecard
- gameManagement: Classes that manage components and put them together, providing an interface to interact with components

Dir src/test contains solitary tests (using JUnit4) for each implemented class as well as an integration test to check the functionality of all classes together.
